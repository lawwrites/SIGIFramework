# SIGIFramework
Using data analytics and The Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) dataset to examine women's empowerment in the world's 12 largest economies 

Data analysis was completed in October 2024 while completing the Data Analytics Nanodegree at Udacity in preparation for my masters in data analytics at Western Governors University. Data analysis is completed using Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn in the Jupyter Notebooks using the Anaconda Navigator environment. Data is pulled from the SIGI dataset is pulled from [OECD Data Explorer](https://data-explorer.oecd.org/vis?lc=en&df[ds]=dsDisseminateFinalDMZ&df[id]=DSD_GID%40DF_GID_2023&df[ag]=OECD.DEV.NPG&dq=......&to[TIME_PERIOD]=false&vw=ov&pd=%2C). Measuring gender discrimination around the world to inform policy is one of [SIGI](https://www.oecd.org/en/about/programmes/social-institutions-and-gender-index-sigi.html#Dashboard)'s aims.
